# multikube

Multikube is a multi-cluster API router for Kubernetes. It's responsible of routing requests to a designated `kube-apiserver` based on client tokens. Multikube acts as a proxy sitting between clients, such as `kubectl`, `curl`, web apps etc, and Kubernetes kube-apiserver thus separating the network into two security domains.

* Off-loads API calls by re-using connections and serving data from cache
* Split network security domains
* Total transparency means compatibility with any kubectl command
* Minimal configuration required
* Request interceptors allows for manipulating Kubernetes objects sent arount
* Audit logs 
* No database or dependencies makes scaling multikube a breeze 
* Configured with a kubeconfig from file or remote http server
* Supports JTI revocation lists in order to prevent rogue tokens

## How it works

Multikube expects clients to send special "multikube-friendly" access tokens when they wish to leverage the routing capabilities of multikube. These special access are JWT's, much like those in Kubernetes, but with additional metadata which tells multikube where to route the request. Obviously the tokens generated by Kubernetes won't do since those don't hold any information about the apiserver. Don't worry though, generating tokens that multikube can understand is as easy as [FUNNY QUOTE]
